"""Tests for ``maxpane_dashboard.data.curator_client`` — THE LIST's fetch layer.

**Zero network.** Every test drives the client through an ``httpx.MockTransport``.
Two offline doubles, and they are not interchangeable (the distinction is
``tests/data/test_surf_client.py``'s and it is load-bearing here too):

* ``_raising_client`` raises ``AssertionError`` on any request, so it proves a
  code path performed **no I/O at all**.  ``MockTransport`` does not wrap a
  handler exception, and ``AssertionError`` is neither an ``httpx.HTTPError``
  nor a ``ValueError``, so it sails through every ``except`` in the client and
  out of the fetcher.  Use it only where nothing may be fetched.
* ``_offline_client`` raises ``httpx.ConnectError`` — a transport failure the
  client already classifies — so it models a **total outage** and every
  ``fetch_*`` degrades to ``None``/``{}`` through its normal retry-and-rotate
  path.

Real payloads come from WP0's committed captures through
``tests.curator_fixtures.capture()``: ``batch.json`` + ``results.json`` for the
view round, ``tenderly_logs.json`` for the log sweep, ``bs_page_*.json`` for the
Blockscout cross-check.  They are read **in place** rather than copied into
``tests/fixtures/curator/client/`` — a byte-for-byte copy of 1.1 MB of JSON is a
second source of truth that can drift from the first, and the captures are
declared read-only.  ``tests/fixtures/curator/client/`` therefore holds only
payloads that do not exist on chain yet: the synthetic ``Settled`` /
``HourSaved`` / ``Rescued`` rows.

Every expected value below was decoded out of those bytes, never typed from
memory.
