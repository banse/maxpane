"""Headless Textual tests for the surf dashboard screen (WP5).

A fake manager returns the frozen ``SURF_KEYS`` dict (no network), the screen
is pushed via ``App.run_test()``, and we assert against **composited output**
(``_compositor.render_strips()``), never a widget's content string alone.

Zero network, zero wall clock: every time-derived string
(``feed_last_post_age_s``, signal ages) arrives pre-computed in the payload,
which is why the fetch instant 2026-08-08T04:00:00Z can be replayed forever.
All sample values are lifted from ``tests/fixtures/surf/captures/`` -- the real
payloads fetched 2026-08-08 -- not invented.
