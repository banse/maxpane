"""Signal analytics for the surfsurf.eth ("SURF") dashboard — PURE functions.

No I/O, no clients, no cache, no Textual, no ``time``.  Everything here takes
plain values and returns plain values, which is what lets the six detectors be
tested against fixed fixtures at a fixed instant, and what lets the manager,
the widgets and the screen all replay the same 2026-08-07 sequence.

Three public pieces:

* :func:`decode_utf8_calldata` — the dev's own monitoring spec (channel nonce
  2, 2026-05-21) says "decode the transaction input/data field as UTF-8 text
  when possible".  *When possible* is the hard half: one of the 21 channel txs
  is an ABI-encoded ``register(string)`` call and must decode to ``None``.
* :func:`classify_channel_tx` — ``self`` / ``reply`` / ``action`` / ``fund``.
  The channel is permissionless: anyone can post, and a scam reply and a
  begging tx are already in it (PRD §6.4).
* :func:`build_signals` — the six detectors of PRD §3 as one state machine over
  (persisted baselines, this refresh's readings, injected clock).

The rule this module exists to enforce
--------------------------------------

**A baseline advances only on a successful read, and ``None`` never compares
against a number.**  The failure it prevents is concrete: ``totalSupply()``
returns ``None`` during an RPC outage, a naive detector reads that as ``0``,
sees 2,376,731 → 0 and fires BURN — and then *persists* the zero, so the
corruption outlives the outage (CLAUDE.md; research §Hazards 5).  The mirror
image is just as bad: an outage must not *un-fire* a FIRED row, because the
one thing a front-runner's dashboard may not do is quietly retract the event it
just reported.  Both cases have dedicated regression tests with recorded
mutation checks (``tests/analytics/test_surf_signals.py``).

FIRED display semantics (PRD §3)
--------------------------------

Baselines advance immediately on the successful read that detects an event — so
a signal re-fires only on a *new* event — but the rendered ``fired`` state
persists for :data:`FIRED_TTL_S` with its age, then relaxes to the live state
with a ``last: …`` detail.  The event timestamps live in the persisted cache,
so a restart neither resurrects nor loses a FIRED display.

Pattern: ``maxpane_dashboard/analytics/fwa_signals.py``.
